### RTGS-Style AI Analyst

Great! Given the available data on **EV charging stations consumption** from the Telangana Open Data Portal, here's a focused **problem statement** related to **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** and their **charging infrastructure**:



## **Problem Statement:**

### **Title**:

**"Analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Usage and Consumption Trends in Telangana"**

### **Objective**:

The goal of this project is to analyze **EV charging station consumption data** from Telangana's **TGSPDCL** (Telangana State Power Distribution Corporation Ltd.) to identify patterns, inefficiencies, and opportunities in the EV charging infrastructure. The analysis will provide insights to enhance **electric vehicle adoption** by improving the availability, efficiency, and strategic placement of charging stations.

### **Problem Areas to Address**:

1. **EV Charging Consumption Patterns**:

   * What are the **usage trends** across different districts of Telangana for EV charging stations?
   * Are there periods of **peak demand** for charging services?
   * What are the **average charging durations** and **energy consumption per session**?

2. **Charging Infrastructure Efficiency**:

   * How does the **availability of charging stations** correlate with the **frequency of usage**?
   * Which areas have **insufficient charging infrastructure** relative to their EV adoption?

3. **Geographic Distribution of Charging Stations**:

   * Are charging stations evenly distributed across Telangana?
   * Which regions or cities have the **most usage** and could benefit from **more stations** or improved **grid capacity**?

4. **Impact of Charging Station Density on EV Adoption**:

   * Is there a **correlation** between the **number of charging stations** and the **growth in EV adoption** in certain areas?
   * Which areas are showing **growing demand** for EVs but lack sufficient charging facilities?

5. **Optimization Opportunities**:

   * Can we **predict peak usage times** to improve resource allocation and charging station maintenance schedules?
   * How can **future charging stations** be strategically placed to serve **high-demand regions** while optimizing the energy grid?

### **Expected Insights**:

* **Trends & Usage**: Identifying peak demand times and under-utilized stations, providing insights on where the **EV adoption is growing** and where the infrastructure needs to catch up.
* **Infrastructure Gaps**: Highlighting regions with **insufficient charging stations** relative to their **population density** and **vehicle adoption**.
* **Operational Recommendations**: Suggesting optimal locations for **future charging stations** based on usage patterns, geographic distribution, and population density.
* **Capacity Optimization**: Recommending strategies for **load balancing** and **energy management** based on charging data, ensuring grid stability during peak demand times.

## **Scope of the Study**:

* **Data Source**:

  * Use the dataset on [TGSPDCL EV Charging Stations Consumption Data](https://data.telangana.gov.in/dataset/tgspdcl-ev-charging-stations-consumption-data) to perform the analysis.

* **Scope of Analysis**:

  * Focus on key **metrics** such as **charging duration**, **energy consumption**, **charging station usage frequency**, and **geographical distribution**.
  * Start with data from **major cities and districts** like **Hyderabad** and scale to a broader view across Telangana.

* **Data Scope**:

  * **Time Range**: Focus on recent years (e.g., 2023â€“2025) to capture trends and make actionable recommendations.
  * **Geographical Scope**: Primarily urban centers (Hyderabad, Warangal, Nizamabad) with potential expansion into rural areas if data supports.
